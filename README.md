## Course Description
This one-day course is for students interested in expanding their R skills to estimating basic populations dynamics rate parameters. Through a sequence of short lectures, code demonstrations, and hands-on application exercises, participants will use R to construct and apply an age-length key to estimate ages of individual fish from their lengths, estimate mortality rates and compare rates among groups, fit a von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) and compare function parameters among groups, and fit several stock-recruitment functions. Depending on time, students may also fit weight-length relationships and compare parameters among groups. Participants should be familiar with the fundamentals of R, including basic applications.
